In this code:

We define a list of supported protocols.

After getting the user input for the protocol, we check if it's not an empty string and not in the list of supported protocols. If it's not supported, we print an error message and exit the program.

If the protocol is supported, we proceed to construct the filter expression and sniff packets accordingly.

If the user input is an empty string, the program will sniff packets without any filter expression.
